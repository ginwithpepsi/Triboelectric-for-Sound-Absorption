# Triboelectric-for-Sound-Absorption
Raw data and code used in our paper _**Mechanism of airborne sound absorption through triboelectric effect for noise mitigation**_

## Raw data for figures in the main manuscript:

- [x] **Fig. 3d** Effect of ECE concentration on the dielectric constant of fibrous TEC foams with corresponding polynomial fit curve y=-0.07 x^2+12.17x+37.80, r2 > 0.90.
- [x] **Fig. 3e** Effect of ECE concentration on the dielectric loss of fibrous TEC foams. The zoomed view shows the ECE weight ratio range within 8%, where the linear fit is y = 0.013x+ 0.021, with a p-value less that 0.01%.
- [x] **Fig. 3f** Influence of ECE concentration on the conductivity of the fibrous TEC foams.
- [x] **Fig. 3g** Modulating conductivity with ECE while preserving porosity with minimized change.
- [x] **Fig. 3h, i** Influence of ECE concentration on the sound absorption performance of foams. Sound absorption enhancement at **j** lower frequency ranges and **k** higher frequency ranges, respectively.
- [x] **Fig. 3l** Peak sound absorption enhancement at 1170 Hz due to triboelectric effect, significant enhancement from 1120-1290 Hz.
- [x] **Fig. 3m** NRC in relation to conductivity follows a similar trend as the sound absorption coefficient. The fitted curves are hyperbolic, where for 1170 Hz is y=(0.784 x)/(2.648×10^(-7)+x), and for 1600 Hz the fit is y=(0.953 x)/(1.275×10^(-7)+x).

- [x] **Fig. 4b** Comparison of noise reduction coefficient (NRC) for TECs made of PP/PVDF, GW/PVDF, and PU/PVDF, with and without ECE, concentration of the conducting elements satisfies the percolation threshold at 5 wt.% in the final composite material.
- [x] **Fig. 4c** Prominent improvement in NRC among groups. The error bars represent standard deviations over at least three samples.
- Sound absorption coefficients of:
 - [x] **Fig. 4d** TEC foams made of PP/PVDF/ECE forming triboelectric dissipators, in comparison with PP/PVDF and PP.
 - [x] **Fig. 4e** TEC foams made of GW/PVDF/ECE forming triboelectric dissipators, in comparison with GW/PVDF and GW.
 - [x] **Fig. 4f** TEC foams made of PU/PVDF/ECE forming triboelectric dissipators, in comparison with PU/PVDF and PU. 

- [x] **Fig. 5a** Distribution of NRC of acoustic absorbers with triboelectric effect. The dots represent NRC values of acoustic absorber samples with different types and varying absorber thickness. The curve on the sub-axis of the vertical coordinate represents the distribution of NRC values. Despite reduced thickness, triboelectric-enabled absorbers surpass acoustic absorbers made of single materials, composite materials, or layered structures. 
- [x] **Fig. 5b** NRCs of acoustic absorbers with triboelectric effect outperforms other groups without.
- [x] **Fig. 5c** Sound absorption coefficient of PU-based TEC foam shows higher sound absorption over commercial counterpart.
- [x] **Fig. 5d** Superior performance of PU-based TEC foam in comparison with a variety of commonly used commercial products.
